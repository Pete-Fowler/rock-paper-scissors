This Rock, Paper, Scissors game was one of my first exposures to JavaScript and click event listeners. Building the JavaScript game logic was a solid but doable learning experience at the experience level I had at the time.

In the layout, I also made better use of sizing units by using relative units such as % and em instead of fixed pixel values like I originally used in another project building a page to replicate a mockup image.
