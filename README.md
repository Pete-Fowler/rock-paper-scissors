This Rock, Paper, Scissors game was one of my first exposures to javascript, buttons, and click event listeners. Some lessons learned included remembering to defer javascript until after the html loads, and avoiding accidentally duplicating the names of variables.

In the layout, I also made better use of sizing arguments by using relative units such as % and em instead of fixed pixel values like I originally used in the landing page project.
